were...

The difference between model accuracy pre- and post-conversion was...

The size of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

## Assess Model Use Cases

Some of the potential use cases of the people counter app are...

Each of these use cases would be useful because...

## Assess Effects on End User Needs

Lighting, model accuracy, and camera focal length/image size have different effects on a
deployed edge model. The potential effects of each of these are as follows...

## Model Research

[This heading is only required if a suitable model was not found after trying out at least three
different models. However, you may also use this heading to detail how you converted 
a successful model.]

In investigating potential people counter models, I tried each of the following three models:

- Model 1: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
  
- Model 2: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...

- Model 3: [Name]
